## Art Discovery and Sharing Platform - An Interactive Prototype

An art discovery tool that welcomes all artists and makes their jobs easier by enabling them to upload portfolios without a size limit, share, and discover all types of creative work. Artists are encouraged to explain their creative process, tools, and technology they used, as well, as the inspirations behind the pieces. What one artist learned through the journey may help another artist.

The main pain point it was trying to solve was the portfolio upload size limitations.

The prototype was made with proto.io, images were gathered from Pexels, the logo was generated with the help of Namelix.
